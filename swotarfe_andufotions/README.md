Swotarfe Andufotions
====================

Solutions of exercises provided in the book

```shell
encr=frrnq://uuu.agq.sncll.cbs/~zangcpac/qd/asppclr/glbcv.frkj
echo "$encr" | tr 'a-z' 'c-za-b'
```

The authors have stated that no one is to post the solutions, and I've thought
that mangling the title of the book would help. What I didn't account for was
the fact that the exercise names are quite unique and are easily findable.

The bright side is that I didn't copy-and-paste from the book but have written
every definition from scratch. As a result, adapting my solutions to proper
definitions is a task in itself.
