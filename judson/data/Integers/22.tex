\item[Problem] Let $n \in \mathbb N$. Use the division algorithm to prove that
every integer is congruent $\bmod\; n$ to precisely one of the integers $0, 1,
\dots, n - 1$. Conclude that if $r$ is an integer, then there is exactly one
$s$ in $\mathbb Z$ such that $0 \le s < n$ and $[r] = [s]$. Hence, the integers
are indeed partitioned by congruence $\bmod\; n$.

\item[Proof] Due to the division algorithm, every integer can be uniquely
represented as $kn + b$ with $k, b \in \mathbb Z$ and $b \in [0; n)$. $kn + b
\equiv b \pmod n$, so every integer is congruent modulo $n$ to $[0; n)$.
