\item[Problem] Prove that $n! > 2^n$ for $n \ge 4$.
\item[Proof] For $n = 4$,
\begin{equation*}\begin{aligned}
4! > 2^4
24 > 16
\end{aligned}\end{equation*}

Given that $n! > 2^n$, we need to prove that $n'! > 2^{n'}$ for $n' = n + 1$.
\begin{equation*}\begin{aligned}
n'! &> 2^{n'} \\
(n+1)! &> 2^{n+1} \\
(n+1)n! &> 2 \cdot 2^n
\end{aligned}\end{equation*}

Now, with $n \ge 4$ we have $n + 1 > 2$, and $n! > 2^n$ by the induction
hypothesis. Since both factors on the left side are greater than the
corresponding factors on the right side, the product is greater as well.
