\item[Problem] Let $a$ and $b$ be integers such that $\gcd(a, b) = 1$. Let $r$
and $s$ be integers such that $ar + bs = 1$. Prove that
$$\gcd(a,s) = \gcd(r, b) = \gcd(r, s) = 1.$$

\item[Proof] Let $n = ar$, $m = bs$. Then $n + m = 1$. Let $d = \gcd(n, m)$.
Then $d\frac{n}{d} + d \frac{m}{d} = 1$, $d\left(\frac n d + \frac m d\right) =
1$. $d$ divides $1$, thus $d = 1$.

Then $n$ and $m$ are relatively prime. But if $a$ and $s$, $r$ and $b$, or $r$
and $s$ weren't relatively prime, then $n$ and $m$ wouldn't be relatively
prime.
