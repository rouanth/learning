\item[Problem] Using the division algorithm, show that every perfect square is
of the form $4k$ or $4k+1$.

\item[Proof] Due to the division algorithm, each number can be uniquely
represented as $2n$ or $2n + 1$.

In the first case, squaring the number yields $(2n)^2 = 4n^2$. Setting $k =
n^2$, we get a number of the form $4k$.

In the second case, we get $(2n+1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = 4(n^2 + n) + 1$. Let
$k = n^2 + n$, then the result is of the form $4k + 1$.
