\item[Problem] Let $a$ and $b$ be nonzero integers. If there exist integers $r$
and $s$ such that $ar + bs = 1$, show that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime.

\item[Proof] Let $d = \gcd(a,b)$. Then $a = d a'$, $b = d b'$, where $a'$ and
$b'$ are some integers. It follows from $ar + bs = 1$ that $da'r + db's = 1$,
i.e. $d(a'r + b's) = 1$. Then $1$ must divide $d$, and the only such $d$ is
$1$ itself. Thus, $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, and the two numbers are relatively prime.
