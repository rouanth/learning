\item[Problem] Using the fact that 2 is prime, show that there do not exist
integers $p$ and $q$ such that $p^2 = 2q^2$. Demonstrate that therefore $\sqrt
2$ cannot be a rational number.

\item[Proof] Due to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetics, $p$ and $q$ can be
uniquely represented as products of the primes comprising them. Let $r_i$ be a
prime number with index $i$, and $\phi_a(i)$ be a function which corresponds to
the number of occurrences of $r_i$ in a factorization of number $a$.

\begin{align*}
p^2 &= 2q^2 \\
\left(\prod_i r_i^{\phi_p(i)}\right)^2 &= 2 \cdot \left(\prod_i
r_i^{\phi_q(i)}\right)^2 \\
\prod_i r_i^{2\phi_p(i)} &= 2 \cdot \prod_i r_i^{2\phi_q(i)} \\
2\phi_p(2) &= 2 \phi_q(i) + 1 \\
\phi_p(2) - \phi_q(i) &= \frac 1 2
\end{align*}

But since $p$ and $q$ are integers, $\phi_p(i)$ and $\phi_q(i)$ can only be
integers for all $i$. Subtraction of any integers can't produce a fraction,
hence $p^2 \ne 2q^2$ for all integers $p$ and $q$.
