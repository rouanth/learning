\item[Problem]
Prove $A \subset B$ if and only if $A \cap B = A$.

\item[Proof]

First, we need to prove that $A \subset B$ implies $A \cap B = A$. If $A$ is a
proper subset of $B$, than, by definition, every element of $A$ is also
present in $B$. Thus, $A \cap B = \left\{ x : x \in A\ \text{and}\ x \in B
\right\} = \left\{ x : x \in A \right\} = A$.

Now assume the converse; that is, if $A \cap B = A$, then necessarily $A
\subset B$. Let's assume that $A$ is not a subset of $B$, that is, there exists
$a \in A, a \not \in B$. But then $a \not \in A \cap B$, which contradicts the
hypothesis.
