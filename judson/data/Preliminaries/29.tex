\item[Problem] (Projective Real Line) Define a relation on $\mathbb{R}^2
\setminus \{(0, 0)\}$ by letting $(x_1, y_1) \sim (x_2, y_2)$ if there exists
a nonzero real number $\lambda$ such that $(x_1, y_1) = (\lambda x_2, \lambda
y_2)$. Prove that $\sim$ defines an equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}^2
\setminus (0, 0)$. What are the corresponding equivalence classes? This
equivalence relation defines the projective line, denoted by
$\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{R})$, which is very important in geometry.

\item[Proof] First, to prove that this defines an equivalence relation:
\begin{description}
\item[Reflexivity] $(x, y) \sim (x, y)$ since $(x, y) = (\lambda x, \lambda
y)$ by setting $\lambda = 1$.
\item[Symmetry] If $(x_1, y_1) = (\lambda_1 x_2, \lambda_1 y_2)$, then $(x_2,
y_2) = (\lambda_2 x_1, \lambda_2 y_2)$ by setting $\lambda_2 =
\frac{1}{\lambda_1}$.
\item[Transitivity] If $(x_1, y_1) = (\lambda_{12} x_2, \lambda_{12} y_2)$,
and $(x_2, y_2) = (\lambda_{23} x_3, \lambda_{23} y_3)$, then $(x_1, y_1) =
(\lambda_{13} x_3, \lambda_{13} y_3)$ by setting $\lambda_{13} = \lambda_{12}
\lambda_{23}$.
\end{description}

Each equivalence class contains all the position vectors that form a particular
angle with an arbitrary axis and is uniquely defined by that angle.
