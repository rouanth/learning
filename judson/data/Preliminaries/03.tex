\item[Problem]
Find an example of two nonempty sets $A$ and $B$ for which $A \times B = B
\times A$ is true.

\item[Solution]
        $A = \left\{1, 2\right\}$, $B = \left\{1, 2\right\}$.

\item[Explanation]

For every $(a, b) \in A \times B$, $a \in A$, $b \in B$, there exists $(b', a')
\in B \times A$, $a' \in A$, $b' \in B$ such that $a = b'$, $b = a'$.  That is,
every element of $A$ is also present in $B$, and vice versa. By definition of
set equality, $A = B$.

\it If both $A$ and $B$ are nonempty and $A \times B = B \times A$, then
$A = B$.
