\item[Problem] Determine which of the following functions are one-to-one and
which are onto. If the function is not onto, determine its range.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = e^x$
\item $f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $f(n) = n^2 + 3$
\item $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = \sin x$
\item $f : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $f(x) = x^2$
\end{enumerate}

\item[Solution]

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is one-to-one since it is strictly increasing and defined for all
$x \in \mathbb{R}$. It isn't onto because it's range consists only of positive
numbers: $f(x) \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$.
\item It isn't one-to-one: $f(x) = f(-x)$; for example, $f(1) = f(-1) = 4$. It
also isn't onto, with range consisting of integral numbers starting with
$3, 4, 7, 12 \dots \infty$.
\item It isn't one-to-one, because $f(x) = f(x + 2\pi)$, and it isn't onto,
because it's range is $(-1; 1)$.
\item Like the second one, this is neither one-to-one nor onto, its range
being $0, 1, 4, 9 \dots \infty$.
\end{enumerate}
