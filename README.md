Learning projects
=================

This is the repository for my personal learning projects. More often than not
there is no practical value in them; however, some code snippets can be
insightful.

Swotarfe Andufotions
--------------------

Training to love Coq with exercises from a book the name of which should be
evident to any sentient being but, I hope, not to a search bot.

Judson's Abstract Algebra
-------------------------

Writing solutions to the exercises from this promising book in LaTeX.

Typeclassopedia
---------------

Solving Typeclassopedia, an article on usage of structures from category theory
and algebra in Haskell's standard libraries.
