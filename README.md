Learning projects
=================

This is the repository for my personal learning projects. More often than not
there is no practical value in them; however, some code snippets can be
insightful.

Swotarfe Andufotions
--------------------

Training to love Coq with exercises from a book the name of which should be
evident to any sentient being but, I hope, not to a search bot.

Clojure
-------

Finding peace and closure with simple yet perfect Lisp by rewriting various
projects in other languages to this one.
